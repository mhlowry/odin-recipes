    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These vegan banana muffins are moist and yummy. You can't tell at all that these muffins don't have any dairy or eggs.</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir bananas, canola oil, and coconut milk together in a separate bowl; stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Divide batter among the muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
