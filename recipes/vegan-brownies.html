    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These vegan brownies are made with cocoa powder for a rich and gooey chocolaty treat. If you prefer brownies that are a little more solid, you can bake the brownies for longer than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the dry ingredients in a large bowl. </li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients and stir until the batter is blended. </li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a prepared baking dish and spread evenly. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is no longer shiny and the center feels just set.</li>
        <li>Let the brownies cool before cutting them into squares. </li>
    </ol>
